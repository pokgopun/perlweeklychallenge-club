   You are given two strings, source and target.

   Write a script to find out if the given strings are Buddy Strings.
If swapping of a letter in one string make them same as the other then they are
`Buddy Strings`.

The swapping of 'u' with 'c' makes it buddy strings.

Example 2

       $target = "love"
Output: false

Example 3

Input: $source = "fodo"
       $target = "food"
