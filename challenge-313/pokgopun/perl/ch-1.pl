Task 1: Broken Keys

Submitted by: [43]Mohammad Sajid Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You have a broken keyboard which sometimes type a character more than
   once.

   You are given a string and actual typed string.

   Write a script to find out if the actual typed string is meant for the
   given string.

Example 1

Input: $name = "perl", $typed = "perrrl"
Output: true

Here "r" is pressed 3 times instead of 1 time.

Example 2

Input: $name = "raku", $typed = "rrakuuuu"
Output: true

Example 3

Input: $name = "python", $typed = "perl"
Output: false

Example 4

Input: $name = "coffeescript", $typed = "cofffeescccript"
Output: true
