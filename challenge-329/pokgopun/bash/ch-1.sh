Task 1: Counter Integers

Submitted by: [46]Mohammad Sajid Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a string containing only lower case English letters and
   digits.

   Write a script to replace every non-digit character with a space and
   then return all the distinct integers left.

Example 1

Input: $str = "the1weekly2challenge2"
Output: 1, 2

2 is appeared twice, so we count it one only.

Example 2

Input: $str = "go21od1lu5c7k"
Output: 21, 1, 5, 7

Example 3

Input: $str = "4p3e2r1l"
Output: 4, 3, 2, 1
