     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a string containing only lower case English letters and
   ?.

   Write a script to replace all ? in the given string so that the string
   doesn’t contain consecutive repeating characters.

Example 1

Input: $str = "a?z"
Output: "abz"

There can be many strings, one of them is "abz".
The choices are 'a' to 'z' but we can't use either 'a' or 'z' to replace the '?'
.

Example 2

Input: $str = "pe?k"
Output: "peak"

Example 3

Input: $str = "gra?te"
Output: "grabte"
